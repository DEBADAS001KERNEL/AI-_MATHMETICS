This program implements a single-layer perceptron for binary classification.
It initializes random weights and bias, then iteratively trains on a set of hardcoded inputs 
and random binary target outputs using a sigmoid activation function. In each epoch, the perceptron 
calculates a weighted sum plus bias, applies the sigmoid function to predict output, computes error,
and updates the weights and bias using gradient descent. 
After training, the final weights and bias represent the learned parameters that approximate the target outputs...
